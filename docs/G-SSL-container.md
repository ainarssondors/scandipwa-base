# SSL-term container

To make application working fully on local setup, and due to distributed nature, we need to use valid self-signed certificate from trusted Certificate Authority.

Service Worker works only on https with valid certificate (green lock in address bar) or localhost.
Warning about untrusted certificate counts as untrusted, so generating and trusting certificate in browser does not work.

## Certificate generator

There is a script in `./deploy/create_certificates.sh` which guides you thorough CA and certificate generation process

Packages required: `openssl`, `coreutils`.

By default it will store all files in `/opt/cert` at project base path.
Your can override this path with env variable `SSH_CERT_PATH`
For example, to make all files in home directory just run
`export SSH_CERT_PATH=~/.scandipwa/` and run script.
Newly generated certificates will be stored in `~/.scandipwa/certs`

Note that you have to update mounting of `certs` folder in `docker-compose.ssl.yml` or `docker-compose.override.yml` to make it working

## What's inside

`ssl-term` container is a dropin container, that is meant to be used in _development environment only_.
It overrides nginx configs to provide:

-   correct traffic routing
-   SSL termination
-   SSL certificates

Out of the box there are self-signed certificates to serve encrypted traffic from 

-   `localhost`
-   `*.local`
-   `127.0.0.1`

Keep in mind you must add corresponding records to your `/etc/hosts` yourself.

## Self-signed root CA installation

 It is a _one time per machine_ action, that is required to allow browsers to treat any certificate, generated with 
 the root CA to be treated as valid.

### MacOS

You might be prompted for an admin password for a few times during this steps: 
1\. Add certificate `opt/cert/scandipwa-ca.pem` to your `Keychain`
2\. Double click on `ScandiPWA CA`
3\. Unfold `Trust` section
4\. Set _When using this certificate_ -> **Always trust**
5\. Restart you machine
6\. Add one more file (`-f docker-compose.ssl.yml`) to you docker-compose command

### Firefox

Additinaly to default import set `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` to **true** in the `about:config`
